# Jumper
Do you want some stick figure's blood on your hands? Correctly guess the word one 
letter at a time before poor Sticky McStickpants falls to a grusome death.

## Getting Started
---
Make sure you have Python 3.8.0 or newer installed and running on your machine. 
Open a terminal and browse to the project's root folder. Start the program by 
running the following command.
```
python3 jumper 
```
You can also run the program from an IDE like Visual Studio Code. Start your IDE 
and open the project folder. Select the main module inside the hunter folder and 
click the "run" icon.
